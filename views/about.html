                <h3>Merriam Webster defines time capsule as “a container holding historical records or objects
                    representative of
                    current culture that is deposited for preservation until discovery by some future age.”
                    <br>
                    Time capsules have been used to preserve what once was in communities all over the world. They have
                    even
                    left earth’s atmosphere with time capsules on both the Moon and in the International Space Station.

                    TimeCapsule is a new type of time capsule. It preserves history for both current and future ages but
                    is
                    buried in the cloud. </h3>
